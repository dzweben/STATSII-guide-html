    Exam 3 Study Guide
    Exam 3 covers course material from between-subjects factorial ANOVA to splot-plot ANOVA. You will be allowed to bring a double-sided sheet of hand-written notes. You should be able to do the following:
    Interpret all figures and tables in the Simmons Nelson, and Simonsohn article.
    List the different ways researcher discretion (aka “research degrees of freedom”) can increase the chances of getting a false positive
    Calculate the “effects” for the general linear model for a two-way between-subjects ANOVA, a single-factor within-subjects ANOVA, a multi-factor within-subjects, and a split-plot ANOVA ( , , , eijk). Do not worry about random effects, like subject effects or subject interactions.
    You will not have to calculate sums of squares, but you should be able to understand what are the sources of error for specific effects in ANOVA (especially pertinent for multi-factor repeated measures ANOVA and split-plot ANOVA)
    Relatedly, explain, in a conceptual, intuitive way, the error components in a one-way and two-way within-subject design.
    Explain the difference between between-subject ANOVAs and a within-subject ANOVAs in terms of design, ANOVA tables, sums of squares, and F ratios.
    Interpret R output for two-way ANOVA, within-subject ANOVA, multi-factor repeated measures ANOVA, and split-plot ANOVA
    In a two-way ANOVA context, conceptually describe main effects and interaction effects. Know what a “consistent main effect” is.
    In a between-subject context, calculate mean differences between groups according to the Type I and Type III methods of calculating sums of squares and explain what a difference between a Type I effect and a Type III effect means
    Look at data for a two-way ANOVAs (either between-subjects, within-subjects, or split-plot) and calculate and describe main effect contrasts, simple effect contrasts, and interaction contrasts
    Apply the post-hoc adjustments to a variety of situations (main effects contrasts, simple effects contrasts, interaction contrasts)

    Here is data on the reading scores (converted to z-scores, so the unit of measurement is standard deviation) of first graders in 2013, by the education of the caretaking parent and income. The numbers in parentheses are cell sizes.
    Calculate the difference between children from low-income families (<$75,000) and children from high-income families (>=$75,001) using the Type I and Type III approaches. Interpret the different effects. What conclusion do you make about the Type I effect of income—is it a “pure” income effect or not?

    Problem 2
    A researcher classifies her white subjects based on their political views into liberals, moderates, and conservatives. She gives them a vignette based on the Rodney King case: a police officer is accused of beating a motorist. The officer is acquitted of assault charges in state court but subsequently indicated and found guilty of violating the motorist’s civil rights in federal courts. Subjects were assigned to either of two conditions (this is a completely between-subjects design!): in one condition, the officer is white; in the other one, the officer is black. Subjects were asked to rate, on a scale from 1 to 7, how much they think this is a case of double jeopardy (a constitutional right not to be charged for the same crime twice). There are 10 people in each cell.
    Here is the researcher’s data & ANOVA table:
    df2<-data.frame(treatment=c("Black Officers","White Officers","Mean"),                liberal=c(3.19,1.91,2.55),                moderate=c(3.40,3.35,3.38),                conservative=c(1.25,4.62,2.94),                mean=c(2.61,3.29,2.95))fdf2<-flextable(df2)fdf2<-set_caption(fdf2,                caption="Problem 2 Cell and Marginal Means")fdf2

    Problem 5
    In 2000, researchers surveyed 726 non-Hispanic, non-Jewish white Americans and asked them to rate Asians, Blacks, Hispanics, Jews, and Whites on a variety of negative traits, from 1 (most positive) to 7 (most negative). There traits are:
    Lacking commitment to family (“Anti family”)
    Lacking commitment of fairness towards all groups (“Unfairness”)
    Being lazy
    Being unintelligent
    Being violent
    Being poor
    Here is their data:

    Problem 6
    We are looking at subjects’ ability to recall characters in a string based on (a) the type of string (digits/letters/mixed – within-subject factor) and (b) the type of brain damage the subject suffered (left brain / right brain / control – between-subject factor). The experiment is using a 3×3 design; n = 18. Note: when we tested assumptions we found equality of variances as well as equality of the covariance/variance matrices.
    
    
    Problem 6a
    Calculate the effects of “right brain”, “mixed”, and “right brain-mixed”. The grand mean across all subjects and observations is 7.48 characters.

    Problem 6c
    For each contrast: (a) identify the type of contrast; (b) write the null hypothesis that contrast is testing; (c) calculate the appropriate posthoc-adjusted critical value; and (d) interpret the contrast, including directionality. (you should be able to explain exactly what comparison the contrast is referring to). (use the Tukey adjustment for pairwise contrasts; use the Scheffe adjustment for complex contrasts).

    Type I approach:
    We have to construct weighted averages.
    Low-income mean: (-.246668 + .301437)/(6668+1437) = -.14 SD
    High-income mean: (.191424 + .502916)/(1424+2916) = .40SD
    Difference: .40 - -.14 = .54 SD
    On average, children from high-income families have reading scores that is .54 SD higher than children from low-income families, if we ignore the fact that these two groups have different distributions of parental education.
    
    
    Type III approach:
    Low-income mean: (-.24 + .30)/2 = .03
    High income mean: (.19+.50)/2 = .35
    Difference: .35 - .03 = .32
    
    
    Wrap-Up
    On average, if we envisioned a world where low-income and high-income families had the same distribution of parental education, we would see that high-income children score better on the reading test by .32 SD.
    If we compare these differences, we see that the Type I approach is larger than the Type III approach. The Type III approach yields an effect that is 41% smaller than the Type I approach. The Type I approach gives us an effect that is not a “pure” income effect. It is picking up also a parental education effect (although the purer income effect using the Type III approach is also quite sizable!)
    
    
    
    Problem 2
    
    Problem 2a
    A 2 × 3 ANOVA of subjects’ evaluation that the government is violating the double jeopardy clause in the constitution shows a significant interaction between subjects’ political orientation and the experimental condition, F(2,54) = 16.716, p<.001, but no significant main effects of political orientation or the experimental condition (ps>.05). The effect of treatment is marginally significant however, F(1,54) = 4.010, p=.51.
    
    
    Problem 2b
    On average, subjects reported a stronger case for double jeopardy when the hypothetical officer was white (M = 3.29) than when the officer is black (M = 2.61). However, this is not a consistent main effect; we see this pattern only for conservatives but not for liberals or moderates.
    
    
    Problem 2c
    On average, moderate subjects (M=3.38) reported a stronger case for double jeopardy than liberal (M = 2.55) or conservative (M=2.94) subjects . This is not a consistent main effect; we do not see this Moderate > Conservative > Liberal pattern for either the black officer condition (moderate > liberal > conservative) or the white officer condition ( conservative > moderate > liberal).
    
    
    Problem 2d
    Liberal subjects report a stronger case for double jeopardy when the hypothetical officer is black (M=3.19) than when the officer is white (M=1.91); conservatives have the opposite pattern (Ms=1.25 vs 4.62, respectively); and moderates make a similar case for double jeopardy regardless of the officer rate (Ms = 3.40 vs 3.35, respectively).
    
    
    Problem 2e
    Let’s make the alphas the race of the officer factor and the betas the political views factor.
    Grand mean = 2.95
    αblack = 2.61-2.95 = -.34 αwhite = 3.29-2.95 = +.34 βliberal = 2.55-2.95 = -.4 βmoderate = 3.38-2.95 = .43 βconservative = 2.94-2.95 = -.01 αβblack,liberal = 3.19-2.61-2.55+2.95 =0.98 αβblack,moderate = 3.4-2.61-3.38+2.95=0.36 αβblack,conservative = 1.25-2.61-2.94+2.95=-1.35 αβwhite,liberal=1.91-3.29-2.55+2.95=-0.98 αβwhite,moderate=3.35-3.29-3.38+2.95=-0.37 αβwhite,conservative=4.62-3.29-2.94+2.95=1.34

    Problem 2g
    Simple effect of officer race by orientation.
    psihat=4.62-1.25= 3.37
    Conservative subjects indicated stronger agreement that there is double-jeopardy when the officer is white than when the officer is black by 3.37 points.
    t=3.371.734110+110=5.7226
    t crit=q2,54,α=.05/32=3.49432=2.4708
    q2,54,=.05/3 /sqrt(2)=3.4943/sqrt(2) = 2.4708 We reject the null hypothesis.
    
    
    Problem 2h
    Interaction contrast.
    psihat= 4.62-1.25-1.91+3.19=4.65
    Conservatives are more likely to agree that there is double-jeopardy when the hypothetical officer is white than when the officer is black by 3.37 points; liberals are less likely to agree that there is double-jeopardy when the officer is white than when the officer is black by 1.28 points. In other words, the “white officer” effect is +3.37 points for conservatives; it is -1.28 for liberals. The difference between these two effects of officer race for liberals and conservatives is 4.65 points (3.37 - -1.28 = 4.65).
    t=4.651.734110+110+110+110=5.5834
    t-crit = sqrt(2F2,54,a=.05) = sqrt(2*3.1682) = 2.5172
    We reject the null hypothesis.
    
    
    Problem 2i
    Simple effect of ideology by officer race. psihat = 3.35+4.62-2*1.91=4.15
    Conservatives and moderates are on average agree that there is double jeopardy for the white officer than liberals by 2.08 points (4.15*2/4).
    t=4.151.734110+110+410=4.0686
    t-crit= sqrt(2F2,54,a=.05/2)=sqrt(2*3.9528)=2.8117
    We reject the null hypothesis.
    
    
    
    Problem 3
    
    Problem 3a
    Calculating the fixed effects: for the race factor:
    Grand mean is (3.05+2.46+3.99)/3=3.17
    αblack = 3.05-3.17 = -.12
    αhispanic = 2.46-3.17 = -.71
    αwhite = 3.99-3.17 = .82
    
    
    Problem 3b
    
    Contrast 1
    H0:1αblack+−1αhispanic+0αwhite=0
    tcrit: t*=3,3022≈q3,1202=3.362=2.47
    African-Americans give African Americans a significantly higher laziness rating than they do Hispanic people.
    
    
    Contrast 2
    H0:−1αblack+−1αhispanic+2αwhite=0
    tcrit: t*=3,3022≈q3,1202=3.362=2.47
    African-Americans give white people a significantly higher laziness rating than they do Black people and Hispanic people.
    African-Americans give African Americans a significantly higher rating than they do Hispanic people.

    Problem 4b
    
    Contrast 1
    $H_0: (0){face} + (1){circles} + (-1){newspaper} + (0){whitecircle}=0 $
    Contrast value: The infants looked at the circles longer than the newspaper on average by .45 seconds.
    t-crit:
    t*=q4,13,α=.05(2)=4.15(2)=2.93
    We RETAIN the null hypothesis.
    
    
    Contrast 2
    $H_0: (1){face} + (1){circles} + (-1){newspaper} + (-1){whitecircle}=0 $
    Contrast value: On average the infants looked at the face and circles longer than the newspaper and white circle by .625 seconds (1.25*4/2).
    t*=3F3,13,α=.05=3*3.4105=3.20
    We REJECT the null hypothesis.

    Regardless if the stimuli is pure digits or mixed characters, left-brain damaged subjects did worse than a combined group of right-brain damaged subjects and control subjects. The effect is slightly larger for mixed characters (MDIF=1.9 characters) than for digits (MDIF=1.6 characters), but the difference between these effects is not significant.
