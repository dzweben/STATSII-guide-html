# STATSII-guide-html

Single-file, shareable HTML study guide for Stats II Exam 3 (SG3), built from:
- SG3 materials
- Lecture Notes 10 & 11 (Josh)
- Simmons et al. (2011) tables/figures

Goal: produce a  that is a *true study guide* (questions + problems + answers + crosswalk), not just an answer key.
